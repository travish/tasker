Tasker - A Collection of Tasker Tasks.

The Tasker profiles are organized in folders into locations of use. Home, Work, & Drive are pretty obvious, I want these profiles to fire at these locations. World tasks could fire anytime, anywhere, or specific tasks that other profiles depend on. World also holds profiles that I haven't made a home for elsewhere.
